# Dia-Eaties Recipe blog
This project is a recipe blog dedicated to low carb and low sugar meals for diabetics, its very difficult to find suitable recipes for diet requirements in the vast sea of recipes online so I felt this site would be nice to have to have everything compiled into a singular space.
I followed the recipe blog for the project development.

 **Features left to add**

- I would like add more sections to split up the recipes e.g breakfast section, dinner section etc
- Add more interactivity for the users like a live comment feed 
- Add a more colouful or tasteful section for the ingredients and instructions part of the recipes
- Give the user an option to delete their recipes
- There are many things I would like to add in terms of functionality and the overall look

## Program Structure

- This is the original Wireframe for the Dia-Eaties recipe blog

![image of the text flow chart for the project](media/dia-eaties-wireframe.JPG)

- The final result has not changed much lading to the final project 
- The number of recipes has been decreased to three compared to the orginal four 
- and the registered user can now create their own posts instead of leaving a suggestion 


## Testing

 - I tested the admin approval for comments and recipes
 - I tested the sign in, register and signout process for the user and admin
 - Tested the basic functionality of the page. e.g the responsiveness 
 - I tested the process to allow a registered user to create a recipe and post it to the homepage
 - I tested comment approval within the admin section

### Errors

  - The main error I faced was missing module docsctring and class docstring
  - Another error was the line is too long error which again I could not use line break as it distrupted the code 
  - The errors in the code have not affected functinality


### Validator Testing 

- I used PEP8 to validate my python code
- I used https://validator.w3.org/ to validate html
- I used https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ to validate CSS
- I used https://jshint.com/ to validate Javascript
